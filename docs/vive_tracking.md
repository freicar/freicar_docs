# Vive Tracking (Indoor Localization)

We use an HTC Vive tracking setup to obtain indoor ground-truth localization for recording maps and steering the cars. Follow this procedure to activate the tracking hardware:

1. Turn on at least 4 **lighthouses** at the power adapter (check green LED)

4. Turn on **tracker on the car (or the mapping device)**: On the car, first unplug its power connection (either tracking OR charging), then press its button until green LED lights up. A flashing red LED denotes the need for charging.
