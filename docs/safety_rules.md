# Safety Rules
The real-world cars can **accelerate very quickly and cause damage or injury** if not handled with care. So to prevent accidents, please be careful and follow these rules:

- Always start the remote first and keep it nearby while the car is running. It can serve as an emergency brake: Force the car to manual control mode by touching the accelerator or steering wheel on the remote if something goes wrong.
- When first starting the car, place it on a wooden block to lift its wheels of the ground. Make sure no cables touch the wheels.
- Keep it on the wood block until you are sure your code does what you want.
- Do not drive the car outside the track area.

Thank you and have fun!
